# ets

This repository is about the work being done towards ETS.

The TamperMonkey folder contains the scripts improving ETS functionality:

1. Use the ETS-TFS.user.js to connect ETS to the TFS records in ECom platform.
2. Use the ets.user.js to add controls that help you filling in ETS records faster.

To install the scripts you need to:

1. Have Chrome browser :)
2. Install TemperMonkey extension to Chrome (see http://tampermonkey.net/)
3. Go to the file location on GitHub, e.g. to https://github.com/alreva/ets/blob/master/TamperMonkey/ets.user.js
4. Click the RAW button.

When doing that the TamperMonkey will suggest you to install the user script to your browser.
You should confirm the installation.

After doing that the script will start working once you go to ETS :)
